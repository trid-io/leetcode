# LeetCode Solutions

My personal collection of LeetCode problem solutions implemented in Kotlin.

## Structure

Each problem includes multiple solution approaches:

- **Brute Force** - Initial straightforward solution
- **Optimized** - Time/space complexity improvements
- **Trick** - Alternative implementation techniques

## Naming Convention

Files follow the pattern: `{problem_number}_{problem_name}_{approach}.kt`

Example:

- `1_two_sum_bruce_force.kt` - O(n²) nested loop solution
- `1_two_sum_optimized.kt` - O(n) HashMap solution

## Complexity Analysis

Each solution includes time and space complexity comments at the top of the file.

## Problems Solved

- [1. Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)
- [217. Contains Duplicate](https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/)
