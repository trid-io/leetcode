# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a LeetCode solutions repository containing algorithm implementations in Kotlin. Solutions are organized by problem number and include multiple approaches (brute force, optimized, and alternative tricks).

## File Naming Convention

Files follow the pattern: `{problem_number}_{problem_name}_{approach}.kt`

Examples:
- `1_two_sum_bruce_force.kt` - Brute force O(n²) solution
- `1_two_sum_optimized.kt` - Optimized O(n) solution using HashMap
- `217_contain_duplicate_trick.kt` - Alternative implementation approach

## Code Structure

Each solution file contains:
- Time and space complexity comments at the top (e.g., `// Time: O(n) - Space: O(n)`)
- A single function implementing the solution
- Multiple files per problem showing different approaches (brute force vs optimized)

When adding new solutions, maintain this structure and naming convention.
